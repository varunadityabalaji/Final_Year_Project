 today will be a SPAC free zone.. Real companies. Companies that make things for real profits. Those are what we will focus on."
2022-01-26 09:58:45+00:00,c,"Take the market back from the SPACs... These are play toys for the rich. Don't fool yourself, you are writing the blank check. I won't even write a blank check for my plumber and he's been my plumber for 25 years"

2022-01-25 18:53:43+00:00,c,now what must happen is the comeback must broaden. It can't be narrow because then it fails.  IF you haven't bought anything it's almost too late. Focus on Nasdaq if you still want to do buying. So far crescendo- retest working well. But must be broader
2022-01-25 18:42:45+00:00,c,lots of a Visa buyers.. why?

2022-01-24 11:16:20+00:00,c,We are as oversold as when we discovered omicron. We are presuming action in Ukraine before Olympics which would insult Xi. More status quo of pain?  Or is negativity a life raft? Discussing all and writing morning memo to club members on this
2022-01-24 10:46:58+00:00,c,We will make this point today: many of the top analysts are adopting very negative stances. To me the problem is an inability to value anything that came public in the last 18 months
2022-01-24 10:43:36+00:00,c,the average homebuilder is now down 23% from it's high. The average decline from cycle high is 32%... Still too high..
2022-01-24 10:39:05+00:00,c,tech shares going down when yields going lower makes little sense. I do not think that everything should hang on Ukraine and that a peaceful settlement can be reached and the bonds may be wrong.

2021-12-01 11:51:19+00:00,c,@andrewrsorkin when you read the constitution do see anything about the personal freedom to destroy the general welfare? Don't have to go far in that document to know there is nothing in there about it.
2021-12-01 11:48:00+00:00,c,There is nothing in the Constitution about personal freedom against the Commonweal. How can people just make things up? And we wonder how come we can't crush covid? Why don't we just give up?

2021-12-01 10:36:26+00:00,c,club members i will be on @ScottWapnerCNBC @HalftimeReport today talking about some of our favorites
2021-12-01 10:34:53+00:00,c,Been seeing this headline since 1994 https://t.co/zJnHWw7NZn
2021-12-01 10:34:24+00:00,c,"Now i am getting why no leader says ""we need to get vaccinated as part of being a citizen here."" The Jan 6th lynch mob comes out in force...as well as others who have fascist proclivities"
2021-12-01 10:33:35+00:00,c,"Topol made it CLEAR that we have a 3 shot regimen, not two.  My judgment: have to have 3 ahead of Omicron."
2021-12-01 09:54:28+00:00,c,"This is THE brightest news yet, Omicron or otherwise....We will beat this with science not ignorance, digital power not luddite lack of reason.. https://t.co/kpeEaCTUew"
2021-12-01 09:52:29+00:00,c,"If things were as horrendous as some make out omicron, we would know much more today about the people who flew to the Netherlands from South Africa."
2021-12-01 09:45:27+00:00,c,I urge people to go back over what @EricTopol said last night about vaccinations. Those who continue with their anti-Semitic comments and their pro-Hitler comments really don't distinguish themselves as moral high grounders. This is polio; let's crush it
2021-12-01 09:42:15+00:00,c,Parse https://t.co/u99pNmC36M .. There were growing pains at Mulesoft and there were currency issues that came up suddenly. But when you consider how much CRM beat the last guidance i think you will say it is worth buying not selling.... see our bulletin from the club
2021-11-30 22:08:15+00:00,c,Selling Salesforce on guidance that presumes a slowdown is a mistake...
2021-11-30 21:58:25+00:00,c,"ATT guides weak...what else is new.
I know sellers want to look right in $CRM ..they will for a day or two."
2021-11-30 20:56:53+00:00,c,Getting a lot of hate now for advocating President Eisenhower's view on polio. How can they live with themselves. ?
2021-11-30 17:03:52+00:00,c,"Was Powell prepared for a stronger strain before he made his case for a sooner taper? If not, why not wait, unless he really thinks higher rates won't hurt this economy no matter what."
2021-11-30 16:54:14+00:00,c,We are going into the slowdown mode i worried about last night. That means after the selling go back to tried and true growth. Please check https://t.co/0vqU7Tzmf3 for last night's names
2021-11-30 15:30:13+00:00,c,"I live for moronic comments like this.  I don't have hedge fund buddies and i doubt the Speaker's husband has any interest in talking to me. However, if i were to call Mr. G.B. he would be scared to death to take the call. https://t.co/owuYxDKNpk"

2021-11-30 08:59:49+00:00,c,"We have to expect as i said last night that the scenarios, all scenarios, include discoveries of people in this country with omicron and talk that the vaccines don't work or if they did those who have had covid have no immunity. These all cause selling..."
2021-11-30 08:58:08+00:00,c,"But remember, knowing if it is hated is my job and i can tell you that it is loathed like i have not seen it. The stock WAS expensive at $200. Roll with me here. This is what the club is about... https://t.co/XeUb4GBFrc"

2021-11-29 23:46:29+00:00,c,"some things go without saying... I was very bummed about the game plan and the endless targeting of Reagor, but we are fans and we don't know enough to opine on what really happened and if Coach Nick wanted it that way.. https://t.co/09Af0mFzDn"

2021-11-17 10:26:34+00:00,c,I keep coming back to knowing that there might be only on TSLA. But the market will create three or four of them until one or all falter. But the  odds favor another successful company  given that there are so few pure EVs. The odd thing is that it will most likely be Ford!
